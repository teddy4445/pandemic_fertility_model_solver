# Pandemic Caused Fertility Crisis
This project simulates the spread of an infection within a population over a specified number of days. 
The simulation takes into account various factors such as the probability of infection, birth rates, and other demographic changes.
It models the infection dynamics using agents representing individuals in different states of infection and demographic groups.

## How to Use
### Requirements
1. Python 3.6+
2. numpy
3. matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/infection-simulation.git followed by cd infection-simulation
2. Install the required packages: pip install numpy matplotlib (or pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Run the project - python main.py

## Classes and Methods
### Agent
Represents an individual in the population with attributes such as age group, gender, and infection state.

### Agent
Represents an individual in the population with attributes such as age group, gender, and infection state.

### Population
Manages a collection of agents and calculates demographic changes and infection spread.

### Simulation
Runs the infection simulation over a specified number of days and records the history of the population.

### Plotter
Plots the results of the simulation.

### SimulatorRunner
Manages multiple runs of the simulation and aggregates the results.
